            <h1>COLD BREW:</h1>
            <p>Let’s make cold brew coffee! It’s easy to make, and it’s so nice to have coffee ready to go. This recipe is written for a 1-quart wide-mouth mason jar; you can scale it up or down using 1 ounce* (28 grams) coffee per 1 cup water. The quantities provided will produce about 2 ½ cups concentrate, which is enough for 5 cups of cold brew.</p>

                <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>3 ounces (85 grams) coarsely-ground coffee (that’s about ¾ cup whole coffee beans turned into about 1 ½ cups* coarsely-ground coffee)</li>
                        <li>3 cups water (filtered water if you have it)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a 1-quart wide-mouth mason jar, combine the coffee and water. Stir to combine. I like to let my mixture rest for about 5 minutes and stir it again; the coffee grounds seem to gain more water exposure this way.</li>
                        <li>Put a lid on your container and refrigerate it for 12 to 18 hours</li>
                        <li> When you’re ready to strain your cold brew, place a thin paper coffee filter or a small, thin cotton napkin, cloth or handkerchief over a small fine-mesh sieve. Pour the concentrate through the prepared sieve into a liquid measuring cup or pitcher. Let it rest for a few minutes to let the last of the cold brew trickle down.</li>
                        <li>To serve, fill a glass with ice and fill it halfway with water. Then fill the rest of the glass with cold brew concentrate, and stir to combine. Cold brew concentrate will keep well in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks, although I find that it has the best flavor within the first week.</li>

                <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 cup butter, softened  </li>
                        <li>½ cup white sugar </li>
                        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour  </li>
                        <li>4 eggs  </li>
                        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar </li>
                        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour </li>
                        <li>2 lemons, juiced  </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                        <li>In a medium bowl, blend together softened butter, 2 cups flour and 1/2 cup sugar. Press into the bottom of an ungreased 9x13 inch pan.</li>
                        <li> Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm and golden. In another bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1/4 cup flour. Whisk in the eggs and lemon juice. Pour over the baked crust.</li>
                        <li>Bake for an additional 20 minutes in the preheated oven. The bars will firm up as they cool. For a festive tray, make another pan using limes instead of lemons and adding a drop of green food coloring to give a very pale green. After both pans have cooled, cut into uniform 2 inch squares and arrange in a checker board fashion.</li>
